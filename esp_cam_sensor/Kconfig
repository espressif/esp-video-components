                This feature exchanges the byte order of pixel data, which is useful when interfacing
                with different display controllers or image processing pipelines that expect specific
                byte ordering.

                Supported transformations:

                24MHz is a commonly used external clock frequency for CMOS camera sensors.
                When enabled, the sensor will be configured to use timing parameters
                optimized for 24MHz XCLK input.

                This setting affects:
                - Sensor register configuration for optimal performance at 24MHz
                - Frame rate and timing calculations
                - Power consumption characteristics

                Note: This configuration is sensor-specific and currently only
                applies to BF3901 sensor. Other sensors may have different
                optimal XCLK frequencies.

                The LEDC peripheral provides a flexible PWM-based clock generation method that is
                compatible with most ESP32 variants. It offers good frequency accuracy and is

                The clock router provides high-precision clock generation directly from the SoC's
                root clock sources, offering superior frequency stability and accuracy compared

            Enable Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) cam driver support.

            SPI interface is typically used for lower resolution camera sensors
            or special applications where parallel interfaces are not suitable.

            Features:
            - Serial data transmission
            - Lower GPIO pin count requirement
            - Flexible clock rates
            - Limited bandwidth compared to parallel interfaces

            Best for: Low-resolution sensors, prototype development,
            or applications with limited GPIO availability.

                Ensure camera controller SPI interrupt service routine (ISR) remains accessible
                when cache is disabled.

                When enabled, the SPI ISR code is placed in internal RAM (IRAM), allowing it to
                execute even when external flash cache is temporarily disabled during operations
                like flash writes, OTA updates, or power management transitions.

                Benefits:
                - Prevents SPI communication interruptions during cache-disabled periods
                - Ensures reliable camera data transfer during system operations
                - Reduces latency in time-critical camera control scenarios

                Trade-offs:
                - Uses additional IRAM memory
                - Slightly increases firmware size

                Recommended: Enable for production applications requiring reliable camera operation
                during all system states.

                Note: This automatically enables SPI_SLAVE_ISR_IN_IRAM for the SPI peripheral.

                Disable the backup buffer feature for camera controller SPI interface.

                When disabled, the camera controller will not allocate a backup buffer for frame data,
                which can save memory but may reduce performance since the system cannot buffer incoming
                frames while processing the current frame.

                Benefits of disabling:
                - Reduces memory usage
                - Simplifies buffer management

                Trade-offs:
                - May cause frame drops during processing
                - Reduced throughput in high-speed scenarios

                Recommended: Only disable if memory is severely constrained and frame drops are acceptable.

                Disable automatic frame decoding for camera controller SPI interface.

                When disabled, the camera controller will not automatically decode incoming frame data
                (such as removing frame headers, line headers, etc.). The raw frame data will be passed
                directly to the application without processing.

                Use cases for disabling:
                - Custom decoding logic implementation required
                - Working with sensors using non-standard frame formats
                - Direct access to raw sensor data needed
                - Debugging frame format issues

                Note: When disabled, the application is responsible for all frame data processing.

                The stack size should be sufficient to handle frame processing operations without
                causing stack overflow.

                Considerations:
                - Larger frames may require more stack space
                - Complex decoding algorithms need additional stack

                should balance frame processing speed with other system tasks to avoid blocking
                critical operations.

                Priority guidelines:
                - Higher values = higher priority (range: 2-25)
                - 2-5: Low priority, suitable for non-critical applications
                - 6-15: Medium priority, balanced performance (recommended)
                - 16-25: High priority, use only for time-critical applications

                Enable Parallel I/O (PARLIO) support for camera controller SPI interface.

                When enabled, the SPI camera interface driver use to parallel IO to receive the
                camera sensor picture stream data.

                Benefits of enabling PARLIO:
                - The SPI can be used in other use cases, such as LCD display, etc.
                - Better performance for high-resolution or high-framerate applications, because
                  the parallel IO can support 2-bit data transfer.

                Use cases:
                - Hardware has no enough SPI ports to use for camera sensor, or the SPI port is
                  used by other peripherals.
                - Require high-speed data transfer compared to standard SPI which only supports
                  1-bit data transfer.

                Note: This feature is hardware-dependent and requires parallel IO hardware support.
                So this feature is only available for ESP32-P4, ESP32-C5 and ESP32-C6 series.

                The stack size should be sufficient to handle message processing operations without

                Considerations:
